# Body-Mass-Index-Calculator-Python
Developed an algorithm in order to calculate Body Mass Index.
This Python function calculates the body max index (BMI). 
In the main part of the program, it asks the user to input the weight in kilograms and the height in meters
and call the function. Based on the value retuned by the function, It prints a message describing the result
(“underweight” if BMI < 18.5, “normal weight” if 18.5 <= BMI < 25, “overweight” if 25<= BMI <30, and “obese” if BMI >=30.
